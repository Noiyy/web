And here it is! New website is **launched**. But when exactly was it?...

If we look at date of this blog, then today's **05.08.2021**. But that's not the "correct" date of launch. Website was actually launched 19.04.2021.  So why am I writing this blog now? The first time when this website was published, it wasn't completely done, so after a "little" break and a more than 3 months here we are!

- If someone's interested, this web is static, but! It's made using *SSG (Static Site Generator)* named **Jekyll**! It's simple, though at first sight little spooky, but good and time saving with static websites. 

- More about how Jekyll works and how it looks, is on [**Jekyll website**](https://jekyllrb.com)

### *05.08.2021* My website is done and OFFICIALLY launched! :)
