            <p> I'm in my first year of university & programming is my passion. The first thing I learned (early to
              mid 2018) while studying IT was creating websites - <b>HTML</b> and then shortly after <b>CSS</b>. </p>
            <br>

            <p> I began self-learning <b>Python</b> during the summer months of 2018 & later on in 2019 moving to <b>C++</b>
               basics, but then ended up coming back to <b>Python</b> in school (2020).  </p>
            <br>

            <p> In 2021, I proceeded to learn core <b>Java</b> & shortly after it <b>Haxe</b>. That's when I began my gamedev journey.
              I've created my first game <b>"Égaré"</b> and Ludum Dare game <b>"Snowcastle Meltdown"</b> during 72h. </p>
            <br>

            <p> After a "small" pause, I started <b>The Odin Project</b> web dev course in 2022, getting back to web development
              & improving myself, especially finally learning <b>JavaScript</b> & finishing some JS projects.  </p>
            <br>

            <p> I'm currently continuing learning <b>web development (The Odin Project)</b> & <b>game development</b>. </p>
