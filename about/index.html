            <p> I'm in third year of high school. The first thing I learned (early to mid 2018) while studying IT was creating websites - <b>HTML</b> and then shortly after <b>CSS</b>. </p>
            <br>

            <p> In Summer 2018, I began to learn <b>Python</b> on my own, which I used mostly as a foundation for progamming and introduction to it as it was really easy & understandable. </p>
            <br>

            <p> In my second year (2019), I started learning <b>C++</b>, it helped me expand my programming skills (different syntax, one that is similiar or also used in other languages). </p>
            <br>

            <p> In 2020 (3rd year), we began learning <b>Python</b> in high school, so I was mostly just repeating what I already knew. </p>
            <br>

            <p> I'm currently learning <b>web development</b>, <b>Java</b> & <b>pixel art</b>. </p>
