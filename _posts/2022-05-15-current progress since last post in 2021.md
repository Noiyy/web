It's been some time ( definitely not months ) & quite a few stuff happened...

First of all, I'd like to begin with what happened in late 2021. In my last post, I mentioned that I wanted to learn **Java**,
which I did and that really helped me with Object Oriented Programming (**OOP**), which also helped me to learn **Haxe** - another
one of my goals that I had. I learned the basics ( no, thanks, I don't plan on touching macros anytime soon :'D ) and went ahead
to start with **[HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com)** - crossplatform 2D game engine (framework). That's how I began my game
development journey:

I went from tutorials & trying out bunch of stuff, to making my first game **[Égaré](https://noiy.rf.gd/games/egare.html)**, which
was developed for my highschool graduation project, and **[Snowcastle Meltdown](https://noiy.rf.gd/games/snowcastleMeltdown.html)** - my
first game jam (Ludum Dare 50) game, made during 72h, which was a really good learning experience. Of course, it wasn't anything great,
but I learned a lot and surely, the next one will be better ;)
- Overall, I ranked 1126th ( out of almost 2k games ) and I had the best rating in Theme category, where I was 320th. I think I had a good concept and I got feedback on that too, but it just needs more upgrades & polish, so I'm currently slowly working on a post-jam version.

That being said, I also got some feedback on **Égaré** from **[Adam's stream](https://www.twitch.tv/adamcyounis)** so I'm **really grateful** for that and I also plan to rework & polish it later on, after **Snowcastle Meltdown**.

Sadly, I'm currently quite busy with learning & revising a **LOT** of stuff for maturita (school leaving exam), with the last part left, which is gonna be 30th & 31th May, so wish me luck :'D I didn't have much time to work on my games, but I managed to update my website few days ago! The main part that I added was my **[games](https://noiy.rf.gd/projects/#content)**, so you can check them there, or on my **[Itch.io profile](https://noiyy.itch.io)**.
- After I hopefully pass my exams, an university interview will await me in june and I'll finally ~~won't have to wake up 5AM in the morning~~ get to go to university, specifically for a study program **Multimedia Technologies** in Žilina.

Lastly, I've paused doing pixel art/digital art, unless I need it for games etc., so I could have more time for other stuff & I've also decided to learn traditional art, as I'm sure it will also help me with digital art, though it's on pause for now too :'D

So that'd be all, I hope I didn't forget to mention anything important and have a nice day! :)
