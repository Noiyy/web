    <p>Topdown 2D pixel-art game about protecting your snowcastle from melting.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>It was always your dream to have a magnificent snow castle in <strong>desert</strong> and now that it’s done, you have to face the problem of it melting down. Protect it by making snow & ice inside caves, where it’s cold and fortify your castle so it may stand another day!</p>
    <p>You start with full water (refill your water from traders), and water’s used for making ice in caves. Specifically, you have to enter a cave, find a pond and pour your water in it! It’ll eventually freeze - at that moment, you can collect ice! If you have ice, go quickly to your snowcastle to restore it a little bit!
    </p>
    <p>Watch out! Each day, the sun burns more intensely than before! How long can your snowcastle hold out?
