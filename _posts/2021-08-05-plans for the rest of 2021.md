There's not much time left till the end of year, but it's still **enough** to improve yourself in several areas...

I started learning web development again mainly because of creating my web. 
- Since I wanted to create a *blog*, I found a *SSG (Static Site Generator)* **Jekyll**, which makes it *quite easily*. It's basically just **CSS** and **HTML**, but **improved** and ready for blog by using languages **Ruby, Liquid , Markdown** and other options...
Since I finished my web, I don't plan on working on it any time soon, unless it's necessary. 

So I want to focus mainly on **Pixel Art** and **Java** atleast till the end of this year.
- I'm focusing only on **Pixel Art** now, but I'd like to also continue learning **Java**.

Recently I made one monochromatic (1 hue) background:

![Island and Moon in Night Monochromatic background](/assets/images/island_and_moon.png)
{: .post-image}

Currently I'm working on another background which is japanese themed, and will be done tomorrow ;)
- You can find **Pixel Art** that I make in menu of my website "**PROJECTS**". Optionally this link: **[Noiyy - Projects](https://noiy.rf.gd/projects)**.

As I already mentioned, I'd like to continue in **Java**, mainly to learn basics. After I do, which I hope will be this year :D, I'll start learning **Haxe**.

**Haxe** is *open source cross-platform* programming language, which is mostly used in *games, web and mobile apps*. **Advantage** of Haxe is the option of compiling code to supported languages like **JavaScript, C++, C#, Java, Python, Lua, PHP** etc... So that means if you write code once, then you won't need to edit it for other platforms/languages. 
- Unless it's not supported, but **Haxe** supports the most used and known languages, so that shouldn't be a problem.
- **Haxe** isn't that popular, but if you know platformer *Dead Cells*, it was made in Haxe :)

Find more about **Haxe** on **[Haxe website](https://haxe.org)**.

And I guess that'd be all about my plans for rest of this year. I hope that it works out, or even do more :P
